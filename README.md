Apartment Hunting website for UIUC students. Written in Flask.

This project is a work in progress, and will hopefully be expanded upon Spring 2018.
Currently, the app pulls data from two leasing agencies in the Urbana-Champaign area: JSM and CPM.

For screenshots, please view the `screenshots` folder.

To run the application, simply clone the repo, install Flask, and run the `app.py` file.
The database can be refreshed at any time by running `main.py`.
